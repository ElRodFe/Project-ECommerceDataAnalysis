# Overview

This project analyzes Amazon sales data to identify trends and insights that can help improve business decision-making. The dataset contains detailed sales transaction records, including order details, product categories, fulfillment methods, shipping information, and amounts.

The dataset used in this analysis comes from **Kaggle**: [Amazon Sales Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data).

The purpose of this software is to clean and prepare the dataset, then answer specific business-related questions such as revenue distribution by category and identifying the most profitable month. By automating the cleaning and analysis process, the program demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into actionable insights.

# Analysis Questions
